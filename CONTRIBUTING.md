## Contribution Guidelines

### General Principles
1. **Dedication to Assigned Issues**:  
   Work on assigned issues with full commitment and aim to resolve them within a reasonable timeframe. Communicate proactively if you encounter challenges or delays.
2. **Timely Progress**:  
   Maintain regular activity on your assigned tasks. Issues or PRs inactive for more than **3 days** will be marked as stale.

### Issue Management
3. **Issue Assignment**:  
   - Issues are assigned on a **first-come, first-served** basis. The first person to comment on an issue requesting assignment will be assigned, provided they meet the criteria below.
   - You may only work on an issue if it is assigned to you. PRs for unassigned issues will **not** be accepted or merged.
   - Contributors with **fewer than 4 merged PRs** can be assigned **1 issue** at a time. Contributors with **4 or more merged PRs** can be assigned up to **2 issues** simultaneously.
   - To work on a new issue, your existing assigned issue’s PR must be **at least approved** (merged or not) before requesting a new assignment.
4. **Inactive Issues**:  
   - Issues inactive for **3 days** after assignment will be marked as stale. After an additional **12 hours**, the issue will be reassigned to another contributor to ensure timely progress.
5. **Request for Extensions**:  
   - If you need more time, notify the maintainer before the issue is marked stale to avoid reassignment.

### Pull Request (PR) Management
6. **Sync with Main Branch**:  
   - Ensure your PR is in sync with the latest changes from the **main** branch. Regularly run `git pull` on your fork to incorporate upstream changes. Out-of-sync PRs may be difficult to test and could be rejected.
7. **Inactive Pull Requests**:  
   - PRs inactive for **3 days** will be marked as stale. After an additional **12 hours**, they will be closed, and the corresponding issue will be unassigned.
8. **Quality of PRs**:  
   - PRs must adhere to the project’s coding standards, include necessary documentation, test cases, and meaningful commit messages.

### Additional Notes
9. **Open Discussions**:  
   - For significant issues or features, discuss your approach with maintainers via GitHub Discussions or Discord to ensure alignment and avoid duplicated efforts.
10. **Communication is Key**:  
    - Use the project’s communication channels (e.g., Discord or GitHub Discussions) to ask questions, seek clarification, or discuss ideas related to your tasks.
11. **Peer Reviews**:  
    - Participate in reviewing other contributors’ PRs when possible. Constructive feedback strengthens the project and fosters collaboration.

## Documentation and Examples
- **Improve API Documentation**: Make it beginner-friendly by adding clear, concise explanations.
- **Write Tutorials and Examples**: Create tutorials or example programs showcasing common use cases of the library.
- **Contribute Documentation**: Add Doxygen docstrings for functions and classes or contribute markdown files to the project wiki.

---

## Coding Guidelines
- **Follow Modern C++ Best Practices**:  
   - Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).  
   - Avoid raw pointers where possible; prefer smart pointers.  
   - Use STL containers effectively.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Code Formatting**:  
   - Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces per level recommended).  
   - Ensure consistent formatting across the codebase.
- **Documentation**: Document all public-facing methods using comments or Doxygen docstrings.
- **Code Quality**:  
   - Ensure code compiles without warnings.  
   - Verify all tests pass before submitting a PR.
